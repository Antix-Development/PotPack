## PotPack

PotPack is a C# conversion of [PotPack](https://github.com/mapbox/potpack), a tiny JavaScript library for packing 2D rectangles into a near-square container.

It exists because I needed a rectangle packer for an application I was working on at the time, and because after a little searching I couldn't find anything really simple.

As it stands, PotPack works with lists of `Rectangles` but can easilly be adapted to work with other classes.
